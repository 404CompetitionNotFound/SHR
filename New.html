        Hey sleepyhead's victim ðŸ˜…ðŸ’—, Iâ€™m really sorry for dozing off like that...
        I know it mightâ€™ve felt like I disappeared, but I promise â€” it wasnâ€™t intentional.
        You mean a lot to me, and I never want to make you feel ignored or unimportant.
        From now on, no more sleepy vanishing acts! Pinky promise ðŸ¤žðŸ’•.
        You deserve all my attention â€” even if it's 2 AM and I'm running on 1% battery
        (both phone and brain ðŸ˜´). Please forgive this silly human.
      </p>
